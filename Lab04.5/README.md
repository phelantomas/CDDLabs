# Lab Four 1/2 – Reusable Barrier Class

Create a reusable barrier class that employs the Semaphore Class. You must  include the Doxygen settings file and a Makefile.
The makefile must now also include a “clean” rule that deletes all .o files from the project and a debug option that allows use of the gdb debugger. Add the -Wall flag to the list of compiler flags sued by the Debug rule. 

All files should now begin with a file comment that contains the following information:
1. Author Name
2. Date of File Created
3. Licence Employed
All code files will include suitable Doxygen comments.  The Makefile will also include comments explaining its purpose.
A README file must also be included.  This is a text file that describes what this solution does, who the author is and the licence employed.  It should contain instructions on how to compile the file and run it.
The main function should show the barrier in acton in such a way that it is clear that it works.
